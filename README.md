# gyul-hap
An implementation of the game Gyul! Hap! as seen in The Genius (South Korean variety show).

## Game Instructions
On the board you will see 9 tiles, each tile having three qualities: a shape, a shape color, and a background color.

To get a "Hap", pick three tiles such that the three qualities of the three tiles you chose are either all different or all the same. 

For example, you can get a Hap by choosing the following:
* Tile 1: Red Square with Black Background
* Tile 2: Blue Square with Black Background
* Tile 3: Yellow Square with Black Background

This is also valid:
* Tile 1: Red Triangle with White Background
* Tile 2: Red Circle with Grey Background
* Tile 3: Red Square with Black Background

Correctly choosing a Hap gets you one point, while choosing incorrectly deducts a point. If you think there are no more Haps on the board, click the "Gyul" button. If you are correct in that there are no more Haps, you get three points and the board restars. Otherwise, you get deducted a point.
